# RandomUserGenerator
This is a Vue based mini project(Using CDN)

Learning:
* mount app - Unlike most of the application methods, mount does not return the application. Instead it returns the root component instance.
* reutrn data() as function
* interpolation {{}}
* In vue we cant user interpolation for image source but have to use v-bind directive eg -> <img v-bind:src="picture"/> (can also use as :bind)
* similarly for classes as well we have to use v-bind
